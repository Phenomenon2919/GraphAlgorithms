#Graph Traversal Algorithms

There are 7 programs present and the language of choice is **python**
##The first six programs
* dfs.py - For traversing the graph as depth first search
* articulation.py - For finding the articulation points in graph
* kruskal.py - For finding the minimum spanning tree through Kruskal's algorithm for a graph
* dijkstra.py - For finding the shortest path between the nodes and the root through Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
* stronglyconnected.py - For finding the strongly connected components of a graph
* topological.py -  For sorting the nodes of graph through topological sorting

These programs take input as *.dat* file and also output onto *.dat* file (except dfs.py which outputs to the terminal)

##'final.py'
* This program takes 7 graphs as input in *.dat* file
* The first graph is input to topological sorting
* The second graph is input to dijkstra's algorithm
* The third graph is input to kruskal's algorithm
* The fourth graph is input to search for articulation points
* The fifth graph is input to search for articulation points
* The sixth graph is input to search for Strongly Connected Components
* Input file is named **"input.dat"** & output filename is given as arguement

##Input and Output files
* articulation.py : art_input.dat & artiout.dat
* dijkstra.py : dijk_input.dat & dijkout.dat
* kruskal.py : kruskal_input.dat & krusout.dat
* stronglyconnected.py : strong_input.dat & sccout.dat
* topological.py : 1stinput.dat & topoout.dat
