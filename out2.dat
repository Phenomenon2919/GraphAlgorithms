The topological sort of the first graph is:
VERTEX	NUMBER
A	-->	1
B	-->	2
E	-->	3
D	-->	4
C	-->	5
G	-->	6
F	-->	7

For the second graph:
Shortest path from A to A: A(distance = 0)
Shortest path from A to B: A(distance = 2)
Shortest path from A to C: D(distance = 3)
Shortest path from A to D: A(distance = 1)
Shortest path from A to E: D(distance = 3)
Shortest path from A to F: G(distance = 6)
Shortest path from A to G: D(distance = 5)

The edges in the minimum spanning tree for the third graph are:
(G,F) (D,A) (C,D) (A,B) (D,G) (G,E) 
Its cost is 16

For the fourth graph, the articulation points are:
D
C(root of the dfs tree)

For the fifth graph, the articulation points are:
D
C

The strongly connected components of the sixth graph are:
{ D E G } { A C B F }
